# TODOS   
- [ ] Implement notification system for announcement approval/publication  
- [ ] Add dashboard home page with data visualizations to admin panel  
- [ ] Remove auto-admin for new users  

## Completed  
- [x] Apply more colorful color palette to front page accordion headers (differentiate different headers, everything being the same black is not good for ease of use)  
- [x] Add small group views and routes, make functional  
- [x] ~~Add connect form views and routes, make functional~~ - Made use of mailthis.to API to have emails sent to a chosen inbox rather than implementing this myself

## Other  
- ~~[ ] Implement notification system for connect form messages to be forwarded to appropriate email(s)~~  
- ~~[ ] Properly implement password reset system (possibly implementing an external auth system instead?)~~  - existing system is functional, will consider migrating to auth0 in the future
